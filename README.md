# Recommender System

This repository contains a recommender system implemented using NumPy. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data.


## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements matrix factorization to learn user and item representations.
- **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)**: Efficiently optimizes latent factors through an alternating optimization approach.
- **Bias Handling**: Incorporates user and item biases for improved recommendation accuracy.
- **Feature Support**: Allows for the integration of additional features in the recommendation process.

## Installation

To set up the recommender system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Train the model:**
3. **Make predictions:**
